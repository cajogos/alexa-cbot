# cBot - Amazon Alexa Companion Bot

The aim for this bot is to be able to answer things that Alexa does not yet know, by connecting to various API calls.

Another aim is for anyone looking to make their own Alexa skill to be able to have a bit of boilerplate code they can use, so feel free to use it!

## Current Skills

### 1. Bitcoin Value

cBot can tell you the current bitcoin value in dollars, pounds and euros. Default will always be dollars, try saying:

`bitcoin value in pounds`

You may also invoke the request by simply saying:

`Alexa ask cbot about bitcoin value in pounds`

### More skills coming soon...

# cBot - Amazon Alexa Companion Bot

The aim for this bot is to be able to answer things that Alexa does not yet know, by connecting to various API calls.

Another aim is for anyone looking to make their own Alexa skill to be able to have a bit of boilerplate code they can use, so feel free to use it!

## Current Skills

cBot can tell you the current bitcoin value, try saying:

`Alexa ask cbot for current bitcoin value`

**TODO:** Be able to give bitcoin value in euros and sterling, currently only dollars is given.
